## Convert Image to PDF

[jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF) library is used to convert image to pdf.

The pdf file name is same as the name of the image uploaded.

Note: 
For multiple images in a single document, file name of the recent selected image is used as pdf file name. For proper naming, please add numbering to those images at the end with a `"-"`  as separator in the following format.

ex: **`image-file-1.jpg`**, **`image-file-2.jpg`**, **`image-file-3.jpg`**

Here, in this case. The pdf file will be saved as **`image-file.pdf`**
